# video-call-webRTC

This is a very simple and quick project to understand how we can use peerJS (that uses webRTC) to model the structure of a basic video calling app.
This uses dependencies like, express (for server) and uuid (for generating unique room IDs).

Disclaimer: It's not a complete clone for any high tech zoom or cisco. It's just a basic skeleton comprising of room-based video calling which can be used to build further into a full-fledged app or as an embed feature in any website of app.
